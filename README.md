pyLibrary - Custom Libraries for Python developers
===================================================
Development in Python (be it website or an App development or implementation of an automation framework) always involves certain operations like handling db queries, operations on web, development of data structures, windows operations (handing services, registries), logging and many more...

What, if you have these libraries handy with you all the time? Just import and start using them.. In comes pyLibrary..

pyLibrary is a collection of infrastructure libraries that aid faster development in Python. These libraries are well documented, provide robust error handling and are frequently updated/tested for improvements.
